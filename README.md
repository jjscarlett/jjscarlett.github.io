# jjscarlett.github.io

This project was initiated as a part of the Secondary Use Data Project (SUDP), Demonstration Project One (DP1).

The SUDP is a multi-partner project to integrate secondary use health and social data for the health and socioeconomic benefit of Albertans.DP1 is one of the five demonstration projects and is led by system partners Alberta Health Services and Alberta Innovates. DP1 will make three aggregate data sets (via three dashboards) available to all Albertans.

Tracking of visitors to these dashboards will be done by adding Google Analytics code to each dashboard. The HTML page with the Google Analytics code is hosted on GitHub.

Add a Tableau Public dashboard to our tracking:
1. add a floating URL container with the URL https://jjscarlett.github.io/ (where jjscarlett is the account name hosting the repository)
2. set the container size to w=1 by h=1
3. set the container position to x=1 and y=1

## How I did the whole thing
*based on http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/*
1. create a repository "username.github.io" with your username
2. create a simple index.html file to the repository
3. sign up for Google Analytics
4. add Google Analytics code (Admin>>Property>>Tracking Info>>Tracking Code) to header
